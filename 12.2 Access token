# Integrity levels
    Low - Low integrity is used with sandbox processes like web browsers
    Medium- Applications executing in the context of a regular user run at medium integrity
    High- administrators can execute applications at high integrity.
    System- used for SYSTEM services

Local administrators receive two access tokens when authenticating. first onfigured to create processes as medium integrity. 
When a user selects the "Run as administrator" option for an application, the second elevated token is used instead, and allows the process to run at high integrity.

we can easily view the available privileges for the current user with whoami from cmd.exe by specifying the /priv flag: whoami /priv
mpersonation tokens have four levels: Anonymous, Identification, Impersonation, and Delegation.10 Anonymous and Identification only allow enumeration of information.
For example, let's assume a user authenticates to a web server and performs an action on that server that requires a database lookup. The web service could use delegation to pass authentication to the database server "through" the web server.


In the past, security researchers have identified1 nine different privileges that may allow for privilege escalation from medium integrity to either high integrity or system integrity, or enable compromise of processes running as another authenticated user.
