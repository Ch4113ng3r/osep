# Bypassing AppLocker with C#

System.Workflow.ComponentModel.dll assembly  --> C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319

Using C:\Windows\Microsoft.Net\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe run.xml results.xml to compile a C# code but it will write the code to disk and that's a downfall.

THis is an alternate method in case previous InstallUtil method won't work
